	Abstract = {Self-organizing feature maps (SOFM) are an important tool to visualize high-dimensional data as a two-dimensional image. One of the possible applications of this network is in image recognition. However, this architecture presents some problems mainly due to border effects. In this paper a new organization of the feature maps termed toroidal self-organizing feature maps (TSOFM) is presented. Its main advantage consists in the elimination of the border effects and, consequently, an increase in the recognition rate. Another important aspect presented in this paper is the measurement of how well networks are organized during the training phase. This proposal has been experimented with using a real data set},

	Annote = {"The border effect is especially problematic when you try to use a high degree of smoothing in a Kohonen SOM, since all the codebook vectors will collapse into the center of the input space. The SOM border effect has the same mathematical cause as the "boundary effect" in kernel regression, which causes the estimated regression function to flatten out near the edges of the regression input space. There are various cures for the edge effect in nonparametric regression, of which local-linear smoothing is the simplest (Wand and Jones, 1995). Hence, local-linear smoothing also cures the border effect in SOMs. Furthermore, local-linear smoothing is much more general and reliable than the heuristic weighting rule proposed by Kohonen (1995, p. 129)."},

	Abstract = {Self-organizing maps have a bearing on traditional vector quantization. A characteristic that makes them more closely resemble certain biological brain maps, however, is the spatial order of their responses, which is formed in the learning process. A discussion is presented of the basic algorithms and two innovations: dynamic weighting of the input signals at each input of each cell, which improves the ordering when very different input signals are used, and definition of neighborhoods in the learning algorithm by the minimal spanning tree, which provides a far better and faster approximation of prominently structured density functions. It is cautioned that if the maps are used for pattern recognition and decision process, it is necessary to fine tune the reference vectors so that they directly define the decision borders},

	Abstract = {Surface reconstruction and structure representation from unorganized sample points are key problem in many applications for whose neural networks are starting a slight breakthrough. In this framework, we propose an original neural network architecture inspired from Kohonen's self-organizing maps, based on an adaptive learning process applied to a generalized mesh structure that leads to a coherent topological definition of the surface, represented by a points cloud, given as input. This representation tool seems to be efficient in most cases but some weak adaptation drawbacks appear on certain examples. We propose local neighborhood propagation and subdivision process that solves those miss-adaptation problems.},

As there are approximately {$[$}formula{$]$} possible ways of partitioning the patterns among K clusters, finding the best solution is very hard when n is large. The search space is increased when we have no a priori number of partitions. Although the self-organizing feature map (SOM) can be used to visualize clusters, the automation of knowledge discovery by SOM is a difficult task. This paper proposes region-based image processing methods to post-processing the U-matrix obtained after the unsupervised learning performed by SOM. Mathematical morphology is applied to identify regions of neurons that are similar. The number of regions and their labels are automatically found and they are related to the number of clusters in a multivariate data set. New data can be classified by labeling it according to the best match neuron. Simulations using data sets drawn from finite mixtures of p-variate normal densities are presented as well as related advantages and drawbacks of the method. {$[$}formula available in full text{$]$}.ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

	Abstract = {We discuss the importance of finding the correct model complexity and regularization level, in the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm. The complexity of the SOM is determined mainly by the width of the final neighborhood, which is usually chosen ad hoc or set to zero for optimal quantization error. However, if the SOM is used for visualizing the joint probability distribution of the data, then care must be taken not to overfit the model to the data sample, similarly as with any statistical model. We propose a heuristic criterion for model selection in SOM, and demonstrate by simulations that the criterion can be used for selecting the neighborhood that suppresses overfitting},

@article{Villmann:1997fk,
	Abstract = {The neighborhood preservation of self-organizing feature maps like the Kohonen map is an important property which is exploited in many applications. However, if a dimensional conflict arises this property is lost. Various qualitative and quantitative approaches are known for measuring the degree of topology preservation. They are based on using the locations of the synaptic weight vectors. These approaches, however, may fail in case of nonlinear data manifolds. To overcome this problem, in this paper we present an approach which uses what we call the induced receptive fields for determining the degree of topology preservation. We first introduce a precise definition of topology preservation and then propose a tool for measuring it, the topographic function. The topographic function vanishes if and only if the map is topology preserving. We demonstrate the power of this tool for various examples of data manifolds},

@article{Kulkarni:2000lr,
	Abstract = {This article addresses the issue of group learning, which is an emerging philosophy in the field of organizational learning. Although not all groups learn, those that do and form spontaneously have been referred to as Communities of Practice (CoPs). These groups appear to be very important among professional and dynamically interactive organizations. Members of such groups come together mainly due to exposure to a set of shared problems, professional and/or social. These members interact directly and use each other as sounding boards for new ideas and help each other learn. Both the business and academic fields have come to recognize CoPs as one of the most important structures in learning institutions or organizations. Identification, cultivation and maintenance of such groups has become a key issue in the field of knowledge management. If CoPs are one of the mechanisms by which organizations learn then it would be useful to acquire greater insight into these groups. In this article, we propose an analytical model of CoPs based on the neural network concept of Hebbian learning. Computer simulations are used to test the analytical model.},
