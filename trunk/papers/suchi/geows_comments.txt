--------- Comment 1:
#The authors present a (new) method of evaluating  topologies for self organizing
#maps (SOMs). The aim is to find suitable topologies to counter the edge effect,
#which is a common problem in SOMs. The evaluation is based on irregularity of
#individual nodes in relation to their neighborhood. Evaluation is performed by
#statistically analyzing 10 hypothetical data-sets.

#Overall, the paper presents interesting, relevant work, even though it is not
#directly linked to geographic information, but provides broader results that may
#be applicable for either the analysis of geographic data or the "spatialization"
#of non-spatial data.

#The paper can be improved in its presentation. Overall, ideas are well presented
#and argued for, however there is same redundancy and/or leaps in the
#presentation (see comments below).

#There is quite some overlap between your introduction and Section 2 concerning
#the explanation of the edge effect and possible solutions. And while the
#(ir)regularity of SOMs is generally well explained, a figure illustrating some
#of this would be beneficial.
I think some overlap is necessary here, added a figure of Rect and Hex

#Figure 1 is a bit hard to read, maybe you could enhance either font size or font
#color (grayscale) to make it more readable?
increased size.

#You do not really explain why using neuron adjacency as a measure is misleading
#(or if the explanation is in the paragraph above, then just skip/rephrase the
#last sentence of that paragraph). [That's in the middle of Section 2]
added table

#It would be easier to map your text to Figure 2 if you used the shape of the
#topologies instead of the authors' names in the legend of Figure 2.
this could be somewhat misleading, since we don't test Ritter's tessellation method (the same as kohonen, but tessellation occurs less frequently.) We also don't test Nishio's method.

#Which ten synthetic data-sets are used for training? You state you used _the_
#ten data-sets, but I seem to have missed which these are.
added explanation of the data

#Section 4: Can you elaborate on the step from combining results of the
#individual test data-sets to what you say about rectangular topology next? I
#don't quite get this argumentation step.
the reason for combining the ten datasets is now explained along with the data

#Your tables 3-4 should be better distributed in the paper such that they are
#closer to the results they report. And they are a bit hard to read as you've
#always need to remember what is above, below and on the diagonal. Possibly you
#could think of another way of presenting these results?
moved tables back into sub-table form, not sure there is a better way to display these.

#What are the numbers in the neurons in Fig. 3? The cluster these neurons belong
#to? Please explain this in the caption!
added explanation to text, but not caption.
