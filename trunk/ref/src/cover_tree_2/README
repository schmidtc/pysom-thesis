This is an implementation of a cover tree in c/c++.  It is somewhat
optimized and not terribly robust.

'test_nn <int> <file>' checks the running times of tree creation and
			querying for <int> nearest neighbors for every point in <file>.

'knn <int> <file1> <file2>' computes the <int> nearest neighbors of every point in <file2>
			    amongst the points in <file1>

The code is dual licensed under the GPL and LGPL.  Use whichever you prefer.

The file 'cover_tree.h' contains the core cover tree computation code.
The file '[sparse_]vector.{cc,h}' contains the definition of a point
as well as parsing and printing functions.  The cover tree code is
templatized, so it is easy to define new kinds of points and apply the
code.
