\section{Significance}
The commonly used tessellated icosahedron based topology offers the most
regular topology.   However, the main disadvantage of this topology type is that it
offers a limited control over network size.  Alternative methods for generating
the spherical topology, which can create a network of any size, have been
reviewed or suggested by \cite{wu2005} and \cite{Nishio:2006fk}.  These
alternative methods produce network structures that are more irregular.  This
research will take a closer look at the impact that the irregularity has on the
training process in an attempt to address the suitability of these topologies
for use in SOM.

\section{Limitations}
This research will look at the relationship between regularity in neuron connectedness
and the training of a SOM. The relationship between topology and SOM visualization is not
addressed. The topology chosen for a SOM has a direct link with how that SOM is
visualized.  When representing the topology on the surface of a sphere issues
arise with the uniformity in neuron spacing and sizing.  Future work may be
needed to address these issues in visualization.

%\subsubsection{Synthetic Data} I will take advantage of weights matrices to generate synthetic training data with known properties.  This data will be used to train the various SOMs in order to facilitate comparison.

%The get at the second condition we must first define the degree of a neuron, deg(n) to be number of its direct neighbors.  Whit that in mind the second condition is that the variance in the degree of the neurons must also be minimized.

%The basic problem of the ``boundary effect'' is that neurons on the edge have fewer neighbors. Yet there are only five possible arrangements of points on a sphere such that all points have the same number of neighbors.  Any spherical lattice consisting of more then twenty (dodecahedron) neurons will contain topological irregularities.  This is to say that not all neurons will have the same number of neighbors.  The importance of these irregularities and the magnitude of their effects on SOM training is not known.  This goal of this research is to determine whether more flexible network structures may be used in spherical in SOM without introducing significant errors. To accomplish this goal, basic methods in network analysis with be combined with the result from several empirical training runs each utilized different topology.
