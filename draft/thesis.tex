% Example SDSU Mathematics LaTeX Thesis.
% Lines beginning with % are comments and are ignored.
%
% The class file sdsu-thesis.cls must be in the current directory or installed
% with the other classes as per standard LaTeX installation.
%
% To generate run these commands:
%   latex thesis
%   bibtex thesis
%   latex thesis
%   latex thesis
% Then you need to use the dvips command to get postscript output
%
% See the README file for more information
%
% \documentclass{sdsu-thesis}
%
% For early printouts to save paper use the savepaper option as

\documentclass[savepaper]{sdsu-thesis}

% This will make things single spaced, use small font and smaller margins.
% Stuff will be formatted differently if you don't use this option but it's
% useful to basically see (read) what you typed so far on paper without
% wasting much paper.  You might want to also comment out the front matter
% and backmatter if printing out in savepaper mode to save paper there.
% Do not use this option on your final printout as it doesn't satisfy the
% thesis manual requirements.

% Also if you want to use double spacing rather then singlespacing (if your
% thesis is very short, say 25 pages or less), then use
% the `doublespace' option as
%\documentclass[doublespace]{sdsu-thesis}

% For pictures, include these
\usepackage{epic}
\usepackage{eepic}
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{figures/}}
% what is natbib anyway?
\usepackage[round]{natbib}

% For chemistry use this.  We've included it because of the chemistry examples.
%\usepackage{dchem}
% For including encapsulated postscript figures use
%\usepackage{epsfig}

% Since this is a math thesis, you quite likely want these:
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{amsthm}

% Other useful packages for theses (see LaTeX docs for descriptions of these)
%\usepackage{varioref} % for the \vref commands that also prints out the reference page
%\usepackage{alltt} % for including computer code
\usepackage{url} % for the \url{http://foo.com} command to include url's (or filenames)
\usepackage{longtable} % For multi page tables

% For commutative diagrams.
\usepackage[matrix,arrow]{xy}


% The style of theorems and such that you want to use.  You can change the
% style by modifying the second argument (for example prepending '\sc ' as
% in {\sc Theorem} which will make the headings come out as small caps rather
% then bold)
 \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[chapter]   %Numbered within chapter
 \newtheorem{lemma}{Lemma}[chapter]       
 \newtheorem{definition}{Definition}[chapter]
 \newtheorem{corollary}{Corollary}[chapter]
 \newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}[chapter]

%  Another option is below.  It uses the same numbering system
%  for the theorems, propositions, lemmas, corollaries and definitions.
%  To see the effect, try compiling twice:  The first time with the
%  set of commands above; the second time comment out those commands 
%  and uncomment the ones below.  
%  The [theorem] entry in the lines below indicates the counter used
%  for theorems will also be used to number propositions, corollaries,etc.
%  Read the LaTeX manual for further explanation.

%
%%  \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[chapter]      %Numbered within chapter
%%  \newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}          
%%  \newtheorem{corollary}[theorem]{Corollary}  
%%  \newtheorem{proposition}[theorem]{Proposition} 
%%  \newtheorem{definition}[theorem]{Definition}

% Author name and the author name in upper case
\author{Charles R. Schmidt}

% Title of the thesis (all in upper case), use \\ for line breaks
% as usual, you can use up to 4 lines and make sure to set the
% counter titlelines to the number of lines you used.
% This is for the title page
\title{EFFECTS OF IRREGULAR TOPOLOGY \\ IN \\ SPHERICAL SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS}
% Number of lines in the title, without setting this the title page
% will not be formatted properly
\setcounter{titlelines}{3}

% Heading style title, the number of lines can be different here then in
% titlelines and in fact the thesis manual requires that this be at most
% 3 lines long so only put at most 2 pagebreaks here.  This is for
% the abstract pages and the signature page.
\titleheading{Effects of Irregular Topology in Spherical Self-Organizing Maps}

% degree
\degree{Master of Science}
% 'Mathematics' for pure maths, and 'Applied Mathematics' for applied
\degreein{Geography}

% If you need to change the word 'Thesis' use \thesisname{Blah} and
% if you need to change the middle line between \degree and \degreein
% on the titlepage to something other then 'in' use \inofand{of} to
% use 'of' for instance
