Acknowledgements & References:
Kirby Urner for subtly guiding my thought processes over a three day-weekend
resulting in this code. Chris Fearnley for providing GNU POV scripts for several
polyhedrons. Most of the POV header sections came from Chris' scripts. POV-ray
is available on most on-line services and through the internet. DXF file format
data is available on Compuserve. Search for file R12DXF.TXT in the Acad forum.

Compliation:
This program was complied and tested using Borland C++ 4.52 using the large
memory model on a Gateway 2000 4DX2-50V.

Comments:
This program is slowly evolving into perhaps a useful utility. DOME produces
DXF file output in either DXF line (for buckyball) or 3D polyface for all
other DXF constructs. DXFtoPOV converts DXF formats to POV-ray scripts. This program
does not currently eliminate redundant connections so that the script files
end up a bit larger than they should. Also it may not be able to handle some
non-DOME produced DXF files. I will be addressing these issues in a future
release.
